Rules

● Checkers is a two-player, with a dark square in each player's lower left corner.
● Pieces move only on dark squares which are numbered. Numbers are used to record the
moves, for example, if Red moves from square 9 to square 13, then it is recorded as:
9-13.
● Each player controls its own army of pieces (men). The player who controls Red pieces
moves first. The pieces (also known as 'men') are arranged as shown on the left.
● The goal in the checkers game is either to capture all of the opponent's pieces or to
blockade them. If neither player can accomplish the above game is a draw.
